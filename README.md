## Owner: Hyunwoo Teddy Kim
  > with Oudome So and Frederick Alonzi
1. Project  #1: Basic Map Reduce
2. Project  #2: IPC based Map Reduce
3. Project  #3: Multithreading Map Reduce
4. Project  #4: Socket Programming Map Reduce

Additionally, 
  Makefile application: Read and parse input makefile files for gathering necessary information used to simulate Unix's makefile mechanism. Several processes are forked as a graph and execute different system calls according to the contents specified in the file. Implemented a depth-first search algorithm to detect a cycle in the processes graph.
